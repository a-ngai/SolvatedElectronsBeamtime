Current version: 0.0

-> 0.0:
    - redefinition of weighted_residuals; weights of the weighted residuals are now the square of the errors.
    - changed function names from lowerCamelCase to lower_snake_case in line with Python naming convention


Previous versions under name "coherent_libraries_vX":
0.0 -> 1.0:
    - ! Depreciation: "cache" keyword for all Run class methods is removed. Replaced with the "use_cache" and "make_cache"
    keywords. Make sure to use these new keywords esp. in the Jupyter notebooks!
    
    - Bugfix: Run class methods now work for datasets when dim(dataset)=1. (Previously concatenated them together by
    accident)
    
    - Inclusion: added gaussians function to common_functions.py
  
1.0 -> 2.0:
    - Bugfix: the rebinning function from common_functions.py now has the correct edge values
    when the new range is wider than the old range

    - Bugfix: the RunSet.give_rundata method no longer gives additional data when getting datasets
    which are 1-dimensional and do not have the same shape as the bunches i.e. file-by-file data
    e.g. 'seed_wavelength'.
    
2.0 -> 3.0
    - Behaviour change: changed the Run.yield_file_data(dataname) method to not raise an Error
    if dataname does not exist in some of the files. If it doesn't not exists for ALL of the files,
    only then it will raise an Error.
   
3.0 -> 4.0
    - Bugfix: the Run.yield_file_data(dataname) method was able to skip file reading errors for
    both 0- and 1-dimensional data (e.g. Background_Period and 
    photon_source/SeedLaserSpectrum_FEL01/LambdaMeta), but not for 2-dimensional data. This is
    now fixed.

4.0 -> 5.0
    - Bugfix: the filtering functionality provided by the dictionary_search.py module did not work
    when the dataset is only a single number and is not a boolean. Now it's fixed (previously only
    detected whether it the dataset was a bool or np.ndarray, but forgot about the np.bool_ case).

    - Bugfix: the filtering rules only worked for datanames which were defined in the alias_dict.
    Now they work even if not defined (e.g. filtering the "electron_tof" dataset with the 
    (pressure>0) worked if "pressure" is defined in the alias_dict, but something like
    (photon_diagnostics/FEL01/Gas_Attenuator/Pressure > 0) did not work previously).

5.0 -> 6.0
    -Bugfix: the Run.average_file_data() did not work. Now it is fixed.
